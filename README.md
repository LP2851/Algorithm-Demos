# Algorithm-Demos
This a program that provides short demonstrations of sorting and pathfinding algorithms on randomly generated data. 
## Sorting Algorithms
Currently there are demonstrations of: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort. 
More will be implemented at a later date.
### Bubble Sort
This algorithm goes though a list and compares adjacent elements. If they are out of order they are switched. Then the algorithm moves on to the next pair of adjacent elements. Once the algorithm successfully moves completely through the list without swapping elements around, the sort is complete. Here are some screenshots of this in action:

### Merge Sort
This algorithm uses 'divide-and-conquer' to split a list in two over and over until it is separated individually by each element. Then pairs of elements are compared and sorted, over and over until the list is recompiled whole. Instead of splitting the list, I opted to split by index to make the animation easily.

## Pathfinding Algorithms
Currently there are demonstrations of: None. 
More will be implemented at a later date. 
### In Progress
Very soon
